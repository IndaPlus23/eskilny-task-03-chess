            For every direction that a piece should move in, generate an offset or a set of offsets for that direction.
            Then, iterate over every direction using the function try_move (see the function for details) which returns two booleans:
                legal_move - if the move is legal; then it is added to the possible_moves vector
                engine_should_continue - bool describing if the move should cause this method to halt further movement in the same direction
            So, we iterate over each offset in every direction until we reach a point where engine_should_continue is false, and then we change direction.

            Note that the pawn implementation is hacked! Pawns do not work the same way, but their behavior abides to the checks performed by the above booleans.
            See their specific implementation for details.

            Note that trial.0 refers to legal_move and trial.1 refers to engine_should_continue.

                    ii) to the sides

                    In the forward direction we allow all moves which don't return a false boolean engine_should_continue from try_move (trial.1 in the code).
                    This is because that indicates that we either i) have run into the end of the board or ii) have run into a piece.
                    The first option isn't relevant for pawns, and the second the method try_move thinks is legal but actually isn't, since pawns can't capture forward.

                    For double-step-checking, we break the loop after the first iteration here if there is a piece on the way or if the piece is not on the second row.


                    In the diagonal direction we do the opposite! We ONLY allow moves for which try_move returns a false boolean engine_should_continue,
                    with the same methodology. If engine_should_continue is false, we would be capturing a piece.
